# profile_spec branch notes

This branch is an attept to use rspec-puppet tests of the profile module within the control-repo working, with the tests in the spec directory of the control-repo.

This could be a stupid idea. It may be better to create a spec directory at `site/profile/spec` and put the rspec boilerplate, config and tests in there.
